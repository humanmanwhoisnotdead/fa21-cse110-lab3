        <b>
            In This Meeting We Hoped That We Could All Share Whatever Information We Each Individually Obtained On The Demiurge And Anything Relevant To It, And Ideally Formulate Some Theories On The Nature Of It's Existence. We Found, Predictably, That Few Had Any Information, And Even Fewer Had Useful Information. Evidently We Will Need More Time To Do Much Research At Significant Cost In Order To Have Any Hope Of Avoiding This Alleged Cataclysm Or Even The Validity Of The Threat.

            <i>While The Laboratories Here In Kendral Are Superior To That Of Most Participants And We Posses Enough Housing For Most Mages, We Simply Do Not Have And Will Not Have Anytime Soon Enough Laboratories For All Mages. This In Commination With The Fact That Most Mages Here Know Barely More Than Your Average Mercenary About The Currents Or Planes, Leaves Us To Ask You Once Again To Tighten Your Entry Requirements For These Gatherings And The Laboratories That Come With Them, Which Any Of Us Would Glad To Help You Revise.</i></p>
